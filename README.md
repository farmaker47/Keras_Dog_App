# Keras_Dog_App
### Android application based on Keras model to classify dog breeds.

This is a demo android application to classify dog breeds using AI.
I have used Keras framework to train a model. For this purpose you can see the uploaded notebook named Keras_Dogs_Soloupis_Final_Android.ipynb
The custom model has near 30% accuracy and produces 240KB protobuf file which is located inside assets folder.
